          1. Terms and Conditions for Service Providers
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.1 Overview</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
          the BlinqFix platform as a Service Provider ("you," "contractor"). By
          using the BlinqFix app or platform, you agree to be bound by these
          Terms.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.2 Platform Access</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          BlinqFix provides a digital marketplace that connects users
          ("Clients") with independent service professionals. BlinqFix does not
          provide services directly and is not responsible for the work
          performed by contractors.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.3 Contractor Status</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Contractors are independent third parties and are not employees,
          partners, agents, or representatives of BlinqFix. Nothing in these
          Terms shall be construed to create an employer-employee relationship.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.4 Payment</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Payments are processed through the BlinqFix platform. You will receive
          compensation for completed services minus BlinqFix’s platform fee. All
          contractors are responsible for their own taxes and withholdings.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.5 Platform Fee</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          A platform service fee of 7% will be deducted from each transaction as
          compensation for the use of the BlinqFix platform, tools, and
          services. This fee is subject to change at any time at BlinqFix’s
          discretion, with or without prior notice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.6 Conduct and Performance</Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.7 Insurance Requirements</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          All service providers must maintain current and valid General
          Liability Insurance with a minimum coverage of $500,000 per
          occurrence.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          BlinqFix must be named as a Certificate Holder on your policy and as
          an Additional Insured to provide coverage in the event of a claim
          related to your services.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          We strongly encourage that service providers extend Additional Insured
          status to customers who book services through the platform.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Proof of insurance (Certificate of Insurance) must be uploaded and
          approved before accepting any job. This document must be updated
          annually or upon expiration.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.8 Non-Circumvention</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Service Providers agree not to solicit or accept direct engagements
          from any BlinqFix customer for services offered through the platform,
          outside of the platform, for a period of 12 months following their
          last interaction with such customer through BlinqFix. Any such
          circumvention is grounds for immediate removal and legal action.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>
          1.9 Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Service Providers agree to maintain the confidentiality of all
          proprietary, customer, or platform-related information obtained
          through BlinqFix. This includes, but is not limited to, customer data,
          service records, pricing, platform workflows, and business operations.
          This obligation extends beyond the termination of their relationship
          with BlinqFix.

        <Text style={styles.subHeading}>1.10 Termination</Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
